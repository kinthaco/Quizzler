# Interactive Quiz - Learning OOP Concepts
# Overview
This project is an interactive quiz program designed as a hands-on approach to learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and data privacy. The program asks the user a series of questions and evaluates their answers while keeping track of their score.

# Key Features
1.Uses OOP principles like encapsulation (protecting data inside classes), inheritance (reusing code between classes), and privacy (restricting access to class attributes).

2.Implements a question bank and a score-tracking system for user progress.

3.Allows dynamic user interaction through an input-driven quiz.

# Technologies Used
1.Python

2.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

# How It Works
1.The user enters their name.

2.The program asks a series of questions from a predefined dataset.

3.The user inputs their answers, and the program validates them.

4.The score is updated dynamically and displayed at the end.

# Learning Goals
This project helped me explore:

1.Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods inside classes while restricting direct access.

2.Inheritance: Structuring classes to avoid code duplication.

3.Privacy: Using controlled access to attributes and methods.

# Future Improvements
1.Add a GUI for better user interaction.

2.Expand question categories and difficulty levels.

3.Implement a database to store user progress.

4.Connect the code to an online quize database via API to increase number of questions
